# OBSOLETE - How to Show a Filtered List View from the Navigation Control

This example is now obsolete, because it uses a quite low level API (ModelNodesGeneratorUpdater), which is required in advanced scenarios only. Instead, please implementÂ simpler solutions in code or in the Model Editor:
* [Navigation System](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113198/application-shell-and-base-infrasctructure/navigation-system)  
* [Criteria Property of a List View's Collection Source](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112988/filtering/in-list-view/criteria-property-of-a-list-views-collection-source)
* [Criteria Property in the Application Model](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112990/filtering/in-list-view/criteria-property-in-the-application-model)
